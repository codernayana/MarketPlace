# MarketPlace

Overview
The iOS Engineer pairing task is designed to assess your architectural and platform skills in an interactive environment. The task is intended to be worked through with your interview team, so remember to explain what you are doing and ask questions where appropriate. You are not required to complete the task in its entirety within the 50-60 minute timeframe, but you should be able to demonstrate your ways of working and thought processes for designing a maintainable feature.


# Task
A colleague recently started building a Marketplace feature which is supposed to download and display a list of products. Unfortunately the author went on holiday before completing the work, and the feature is required for the next release. You’ve been sent a zip file containing the project. Your task is to add a new screen to display a list of downloaded products to the user. The app should…


● Download and parse a list of products from: https://api.gousto.co.uk/products/v2.0/products?image_sizes[]=750


● Display those downloaded products in a scrollable list to the user


● Download & display the corresponding image for each product


# Tips
● Some data models have been provided in the codebase already which you can use.


● Remember this is a pairing session, use us to bounce ideas off, this will help us understand your thought process and allow us to provide guidance if you need it.


● Try to approach the task as if you were targeting a production level app, think of the processes you would normally go through.


● There are going to be some concessions as the session is only short, so tell us about any concessions or tradeoffs you make.


● Don’t get bogged down in the details!
